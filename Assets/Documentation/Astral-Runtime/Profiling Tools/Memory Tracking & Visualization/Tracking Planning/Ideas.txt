Desires for Memory Tracking
- tracking allocations by each allocator
- Tracking allocations by each system
- Tracking allocations in a scope
- Tracking current memory usage in a graph
- Tracking allocations by thread
- Tracking stack traces and the file and line where each allocation was made
- tracking allocated pointers
- Tracking the no tracked allocations separately
- Tracking the size of each allocation
- Track memory leaks kinda like how a garbage collector knows when an object should be freed
- Tracking should be enabled on init and shutdown and toggled during engine loop
- Track memory leaks for pointers not freed at program exit
- Use ImGui to enable stack traces or to start recording a profiling
- export into multiple types -> csv files, yaml files, json files, etc
    - exporting a csv would allow for graphing with ImGui and Excel
- Graphs for each data point measuring over time
