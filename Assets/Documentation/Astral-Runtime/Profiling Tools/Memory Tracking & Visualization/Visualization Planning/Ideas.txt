Memory Metrics Visualizer Ideas:
- chrome trace
- Some other third party viewer
- Custom ImGui tool
    - ImPlot would be way more extendable and modifiable and is integrated into ImGui very nicely
    - Separate application that loads the file and makes a graph from it
        - Make a template for applications


- Add the ability to add labels from the code during a memory profiling scene


Graphs for:
- Total Memory Usage graph
- Allocation Count Globally
- Allocation Count by system graph
- Allocation Count by thread graph
- Allocation Count by allocator graph
- Memory Usage Globally graph
- Memory Usage by system graph
- Memory Usage by thread graph
- Memory Usage by allocator graph
- Peak Memory Usage Globally graph
- Peak Memory Usage by system graph
- Peak Memory Usage by thread graph
- Peak Memory Usage by allocator graph
- Active Allocations Globally graph
- Active Allocations by system graph
- Active Allocations by thread graph
- Active Allocations by allocator graph
(for now)
